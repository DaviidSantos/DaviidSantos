### A bit about me
Hey, I am David Santos! I'm currently graduating in System Analysis and Development at Fatec Indaiatuba.

I grew up learning everything I could on the internet, and programming caught my attention the most.

I've always been a rapid learner and passionate about knowing how things work.

I like basketball, animals, anime and coding üñ•Ô∏è

I'm currently improving my technical skills, studyng Java, Spring Boot and JUnit

I'm also interested in Go and functional programming, especially OCaml.
