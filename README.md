### Heya! 👋

### A bit about me
I am David Santos! I'm currently graduating in System Analysis and Development at Fatec Indaiatuba.

I grew up learning everything I could on the internet, and programming caught my attention the most.

I've always been a rapid learner and passionate about knowing how things work.

I like basketball, animals and coding 🖥️

I'm currently improving my technical skills, studying Java and Angular.

I'm also interested in Rust
